A hot potato
A picture is worth a thousand words
A penny for your thoughts
Add insult to injury
At the drop of a hat
Back to the drawing board
Ball is in your court
Barking up the wrong tree
Beat around the bush
Best of both worlds
Best thing since sliced bread
Bite off more than you can chew
Blessing in disguise
Burn the midnight oil
Cant judge a book by its cover
Costs an arm and a leg
Cross that bridge when you come to it
Cry over spilt milk
Curiosity killed the cat
Cut corners
Devils Advocate
Dont give up your day job
Dont put all your eggs in one basket
Drastic times call for drastic measures
Elvis has left the building
Every cloud has a silver lining
Feel a bit under the weather
Give the benefit of the doubt
Heard it on the grapevine
Hit the nail on the head
Hit the sack
Hit the sheets
Hit the sack hay
In the heat of the moment
It takes two to tango
Jump on the bandwagon
Kill two birds with one stone
Last straw
Let sleeping dogs lie
Let the cat out of the bag
Make a long story short
Method to my madness
Miss the boat
Not a spark of decency
Not playing with a full deck
Off ones rocker
On the ball
On the fence
Once in a blue moon
Piece of cake
Pull the wool over other peoples eyes
See eye to eye
Speak of the devil
Steal someones thunder
Take with a grain of salt
Taste of your own medicine
To hear something straight from the horses mouth
Whole nine yards
Wouldnt be caught dead
Your guess is as good as mine
